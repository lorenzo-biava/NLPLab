## Summary

This projects host some experiments related to Natural Language Processing, organized in two different parts: Morphological & Syntactic analysis, Semantic analysis.

#### Morphological & Syntactic analysis contains:
* An Hidden Markov Model PoS Tagger implementation and a Most Frequent PoS Tagger, with a benchmark utility
* A PCFG parser (with CKY algorithm implementation) with benchmark
* A sample translator from English to Yoddish (i.e. switching from SVO syntax to XSV)

#### Semantic analysis contains:
* A WSD sample project (using WordNet & BabelNet)
* A Rocchio classification algorithm implementation
* A RDF & SPARQL sample project

These experiments are part of [_Cognitive Systems_](http://www.educ.di.unito.it/index.php/info-utili/corso?cod=MFN0949&codA=&year=2014&orienta=HO "Link to the course") course from University of Turin.
