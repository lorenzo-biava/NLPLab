Russia creates its own Silicon Valley.

It may not have California's weather, ocean views or coffee culture, but a Moscow suburb will be the site of Russia's version of Silicon Valley.
Skolkovo district has been selected as the site for a huge science park, where the government will invest billions of dollars to help boost the nation's technology industry.

It is a sleepy, rural area about 20 kilometres west of central Moscow, where wealthy Russians have dachas, or holiday homes.
The park will be built on land owned by Russia's ministry of agriculture near the village of Nemchinovo.
It is a small place where the action is limited. There is a bus stop and a kiosk selling newspapers and snacks.

But Skolkovo will have some important attractions.
Tax breaks and other funding will be offered to selected companies.

The project will also be largely autonomous with its own water and power supplies amenities that can often be frustrating to secure for Russian companies.

The project has powerful leadership. The Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg is in charge and he hopes that one day the region will produce Nobel Prize winners.
Also, big new business school is being built on the edge of Nemchinovo, with upmarket houses and flats nearby.
Konstantin Sonin, a professor of economics at the New School of Economics in Moscow, is optimistic about the project's potential.
But he also warns that there is a danger that it will go the old Russian way, everything that is going to be built is going to involve a lot of corruption and bribery that will drive up the cost of everything.
